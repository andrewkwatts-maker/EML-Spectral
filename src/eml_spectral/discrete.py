"""
Discrete / Planck-scale quantization helpers for EMLPoint coordinates.

Provides a quantization grid at scale D and lattice-adjacency detection.

Note: the "Planck lattice" here is a computational discretization whose
grid spacing is set to the Planck length (≈ 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m) via the
constant PLANCK_D = 1/l_planck. This is a numerical convenience — it is
not derived from a physical theory of quantum gravity and should not be
interpreted as a physically fundamental lattice structure.
